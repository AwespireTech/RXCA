# RXCA

[miXed organization Certification Authority](https://xca.nat.gov.tw/)(XCA) certificates are credentials issued by the Taiwanese government to organizations and groups for online identity verification.

This project further explores how emerging Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) should apply to the government, to become government-approved entities and enjoy the validity of the certificates.

As a Proof of Concept (PoC) verification case, this project proposes two methods: 
* Apply using the original chip card
* Fill out a form using the international standard [DAOstar](https://daostar.org/). 
 
After aprroval by the official deparment's wallet, a soulbound token will be issued to the DAO's governance wallet, serving as the decentralized version of the physical XCA certificate.
